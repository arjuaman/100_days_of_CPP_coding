Given two binary trees, return whether or not both trees have the same leaf sequence. 
Two trees have the same leaf sequence if both trees’ leaves read the same from left to right.
Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.
Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

Ex: Given the following trees…

   1
 /   \
1     3
and


   7
 /   \
1     2
return false as both the trees' leaves don't read the same from left to right (i.e. [1, 3] and [1, 2]).

Ex: Given the following trees…

    8
   / \
  2   29
    /  \
   3    9
and

    8
   / \
  2  29
 /   /  \
2   3    9
     \
      3
return true as both the trees' leaves read the same from left to right (i.e. [2, 3, 9] and [2, 3, 9]).
